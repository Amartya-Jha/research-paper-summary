## Introduction

The prime aim of this work is to urge ways in which the concept of Pell’s equation can be used in Public key Cryptography techniques.

Conventionally, there are two kinds of systems in Cryptography. System that use one key for both encipher and decipher are referred as “Symmetric Cryptosystems”. The distinguishing factor in these systems is the usage of a single key shared at the sender’s end for encryption and at the receiver’s end for decryption.

Since a single key is envolved in encryption, decryption and key it is vulnerable. TO tackle these problems public key crytography was introduced which involves one key for encrypting the message and another for decrypting on the receiver's end.

## Pell's equation
Invented by and named after John Pell

x^2 − dy^2 = 1

where d is a non-negative, non-square integer and x and y can have infinite positive integral solutions.

## Quadratic equations

A second degree quadratic is

ax2 + bx + c = 0

## Research Method

In this method the key proposed key generation architecture is as follows:
